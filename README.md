# Little bash scripts

Collection of simple bash scripts to make my dev life easier :)

## Scripts included

- `gen_prettier`: small script to generate a prettier config file with my most used settings
- `tmux_sessioner`: small script to open a new tmux session located in a folder selected interactively with fzf.
- `cheat`: script to go through cheat sheets about different languages and core utils in the terminal. It uses [cheat.sh](https://cht.sh/).
